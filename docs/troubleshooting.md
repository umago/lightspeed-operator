# Troubleshooting

Common failures, how to diagnose them, and where to get help if none of
this resolves it.

## Start with the resource's conditions

```bash
oc describe -n <namespace> openstacklightspeed
```

| Condition | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `OpenStackLightspeedReady` | Overall readiness. `False`/`Unknown`: engine, database, OKP, or console plugin hasn't converged yet. |
| `OpenStackLightspeedMCPServerReady` | Only relevant with `rhoso_mcps` enabled. Tracks the MCP sidecar. |

## Deployment-specific issues

### lightspeed-stack (engine) pod not becoming healthy

```bash
oc logs -n <namespace> deploy/lightspeed-stack-deployment -c lightspeed-service-api
oc logs -n <namespace> deploy/lightspeed-stack-deployment -c ogx
```

Usual causes: bad/unreachable `models[].llmEndpoint`, invalid `apitoken`,
or a missing `tlsCACertBundle` for a self-signed endpoint. ogx logs
the actual auth/TLS error from the provider.

### PostgreSQL pod not starting

```bash
oc logs -n <namespace> deploy/lightspeed-postgres-server
```

Shrinking `spec.database.size` below the existing PVC is rejected (not
supported in place). Revert the size, or delete/recreate the PVC to
actually shrink it (loses data).

(console-widget-not-appearing)=
### Console widget not appearing

- Confirm the `ConsolePlugin` (`lightspeed-console-plugin`) exists and
  is listed under `spec.plugins` on `oc get
  console.operator.openshift.io cluster -o yaml`.
- Newly-activated plugins need a moment — click **refresh** on the
  console notification.
- Check the plugin's pod logs for TLS errors — its service-ca certificate
  can take a few seconds to appear after first deploy.

(imagepullbackoff)=
### ImagePullBackOff on any operator-managed pod

The console plugin and OKP pods come from `registry.redhat.io`, not
`quay.io`:

```console
Failed to pull image "registry.redhat.io/...": unauthorized: Please login to the Red Hat Registry using your Customer Portal credentials.
```

Means the pull secret is missing `registry.redhat.io` credentials — see
{ref}`redhat-registry-access` to fix and verify with Podman.

### CA bundle errors

If `tlsCACertBundle` causes a CA parsing error, check every key in the
ConfigMap's `data` for valid PEM data and no stray whitespace (all keys
are parsed, not just one named `cert`).

## Getting operator logs

```bash
oc logs -n <operator-namespace> deploy/openstack-lightspeed-operator-controller-manager
```

Still stuck? See {doc}`index` for the repos to file an issue against.
When filing one, include `oc describe -n openstack-lightspeed
openstacklightspeed` output, pod logs, and your CR spec — **redact API
tokens, endpoint URLs/hostnames, and any retrieved context from all
three** before posting, since these are public issue trackers.
