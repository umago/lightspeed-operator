# Installation Guide

This page covers prerequisites, installing the operator, setting up LLM
credentials, and deploying `OpenStackLightspeed`. No cluster yet? See
{ref}`dont-have-a-cluster-yet-crc`

## Prerequisites

- An OpenShift cluster (4.16+).

  > [!WARNING]
  > Known issue: the console UI does not currently work on OpenShift 4.20
  > or newer. Stick to 4.18 until this is resolved.

- An LLM endpoint and API key — any provider from
  {ref}`supported-providers` works.
- A free Red Hat Developer account, to pull some images from
  `registry.redhat.io` — see {ref}`redhat-registry-access` below.
- Optional: RHOSO installed, only needed for the experimental
  cluster-introspection feature ({doc}`usage`).

(redhat-registry-access)=
## Access to registry.redhat.io images

The console plugin and OKP images (both always deployed) come from
`registry.redhat.io` rather than `quay.io`. This requires a **free**
account you can create by following these steps:

1. Create a free account at [developers.redhat.com](https://developers.redhat.com/).
2. Download a pull secret from the [Hybrid Cloud Console](https://console.redhat.com/).
3. Add it to your cluster:

   - **CRC**: pass it as `PULL_SECRET` when creating the cluster — see
     {ref}`dont-have-a-cluster-yet-crc`.
   - **Existing cluster**: merge it into the cluster-wide pull secret:

     ```bash
     oc get secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config -o jsonpath='{.data.\.dockerconfigjson}' \
       | base64 -d > pull-secret.json
     # merge the downloaded auths into pull-secret.json, then:
     oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config \
       --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=pull-secret.json
     ```

4. Verify the cluster itself can pull, using its own pull secret:

   ```console
   $ oc run registry-pull-test --image=registry.redhat.io/openshift-lightspeed/lightspeed-console-plugin-pf5-rhel9:1.0.12 --restart=Never
   $ oc get pod registry-pull-test
   ```

   Any status other than `ImagePullBackOff`/`ErrImagePull` means it's
   working — clean up with `oc delete pod registry-pull-test`. If you do
   see it, the secret from the previous step didn't propagate — see
   {ref}`console-widget-not-appearing`.

(installing-the-operator)=
## Installing the operator

1. **Operators → OperatorHub**, search for **"OpenStack Lightspeed
   (Community)"**.
2. Click **Install**, choosing the `openstack-lightspeed` namespace.
3. Track progress under **Operators → Installed Operators**, or:

   ```console
   $ oc get -n openstack-lightspeed pods
   NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   openstack-lightspeed-operator-controller-manager-76df7fbfb5wggr   1/1     Running   0          72s
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently published for OpenShift 4.16 and 4.18 specifically — on
> other versions it won't appear in OperatorHub search. Use the
> alternative below instead.

**Alternative — deploy from source** (for testing an unreleased build, or
if your OpenShift version isn't in the catalog yet):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/lightspeed-operator.git
cd lightspeed-operator
make openstack-lightspeed-deploy
```

This sets up its own `CatalogSource`, namespace, and `Subscription` —
bypassing OperatorHub entirely.

## Setting up LLM credentials

You need an API key, endpoint URL, and model name.

Create the API key secret — the key **must** be named `apitoken`:

```bash
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: openstack-lightspeed-apitoken
  namespace: openstack-lightspeed
stringData:
  apitoken: <your-llm-api-key>
EOF
```

Using a self-hosted endpoint with a self-signed certificate (e.g. vLLM,
Ollama)? Add its CA bundle too — any key name works, PEM data is all
that's parsed:

```bash
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: openstack-lightspeed-certs
  namespace: openstack-lightspeed
data:
  cert: |
$(sed 's/^/    /' /path/to/cert.crt)
EOF
```

Public providers (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) don't need this — skip straight to
the next step.

## Deploying OpenStackLightspeed

At minimum, set `lightspeed.defaultModel` and one entry in `models[]`
with `llmEndpoint`, `llmEndpointType`, `modelName`, and
`llmCredentials` — see {doc}`configuration` for the full list of
supported `models[].llmEndpointType` values and everything else:

```yaml
apiVersion: lightspeed.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackLightspeed
metadata:
  name: openstack-lightspeed
  namespace: openstack-lightspeed
spec:
  tlsCACertBundle: openstack-lightspeed-certs # optional
  lightspeed:
    defaultModel: my-model
  models:
    - name: my-model
      llmEndpoint: https://<llm-provider-host>:<port>/v1
      llmEndpointType: <provider-type>
      llmCredentials: openstack-lightspeed-apitoken
      modelName: <model-name>
```

This deploys the full stack: the AI engine (lightspeed-stack and
OGX), PostgreSQL, OKP, and the console plugin.

## Verifying the deployment

```bash
oc describe -n openstack-lightspeed openstacklightspeed
oc get -n openstack-lightspeed deployments,pods
```

Not reaching `Ready`? See {doc}`troubleshooting`.

## Accessing the assistant

```bash
oc whoami --show-console
```

Open that URL and use the Lightspeed widget (lower-right corner). First
time activating the plugin, you may need to click **refresh** on the
console notification that appears.
